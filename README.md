# smirky-games-website

Little, cozy website for our company, [smirky-games](https://smirky-games.com). Feel free to use any code you like from this project and to ask any question you like in the [issues section](https://github.com/AntonioDell/smirky-games-website/issues) :)
We use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) as main framework and [PixiJS](https://pixijs.io/) for more complicated stuff, like mini-games.
Follow the development on our [Trello-Board](https://trello.com/b/igRqIVRv/smirkygames-website).
